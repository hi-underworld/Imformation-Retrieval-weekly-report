# Imformation-Retrieval-weekly-report
This is the weekly report for each chapter of Introduction to Imformation Retrieval. 

Update at least once a week, maybe twice a week, if I have so much spare time after finishing the tasks in class.(Actually, I also need some time to relax like playing games Ahhhhhhh).


this is the link for some resource for this book:http://informationretrieval.org

I'm so ashamed that I didn't read the book and write the report during from 7th July to 19th July because I take part in the summer school raised by WHU & AntChain.
And I will accomplish the reading task as soon as possible.
