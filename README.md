# Imformation-Retrieval-weekly-report
This is the weekly report for each chapter of Introduction to Imformation Retrieval. 

Update at least once a week, maybe twice a week, if I have so much spare time after finishing the tasks in class.(Actually, I also need some time to relax like playing games Ahhhhhhh).
